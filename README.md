# store-web

This code is for a React app that displays a list of products and a wishlist. It imports the useEffect and useState hooks from the 'react' library, as well as an image file and a CSS file. It also imports two components, "Product" and "WishList", and an http service called "HttpService".

The App component uses the useState hook to create a state variable called "products" which is initially set to an empty array. It also creates an instance of the HttpService called "http".

The useEffect hook is used to fetch data from the server when the component is first rendered. It calls the "http.getProducts()" method and sets the "products" state variable to the data that is returned.

The component also has a function called "loadData" which also fetch the data from the server and set the "products" state variable to the data.

The component also has a function called "productList" that maps over the products in the "products" state variable and returns JSX for each product.

Finally, the component returns JSX that renders the app's layout, including the image and CSS, the product list, and the wishlist component.
